# nethut WordPress Theme

This is the custom [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) theme I use for my old website at http://www.nethut.pl. The site isn't being updated for a while now and the layout is old too, I just moved it from a previous build on top of TextPattern to WordPress for easier maintenance.
